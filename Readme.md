Tool to edit Night in the Woods dialogue.
(Hopefully) fixed for Build 406, AKA "Weird Autumn Edition", by Captain Southbird!

For more info on the yarn format see [InfiniteAmmoInc/Yarn](https://github.com/InfiniteAmmoInc/Yarn) and for more info on editing specific to NITW see [Editing Dialogue on the NITW wiki](https://nightinthewoods.gamepedia.com/Editing_Dialogue).

### How To

  - [Download](https://github.com/captainsouthbird/NITW-Dialogue-Tool/releases) the latest version, extract it somehwere and open it
  - Check if the path is correct on the "More" tab
  - Press the "Run Setup" button
  - Once the setup is complete press the "Enable File Watcher" button
  - Edit a .yarn.txt file in the "yarn files" folder
  - Start NITW and your edits should be there (to see changes NITW must be restarted)
